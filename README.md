E-Commerce App

Welcome to the sample code for an E-commerce app! This project has been bootstrapped with Create React App, and it includes the basic setup for building an e-commerce platform. You can use this as a starting point for your own e-commerce application development.
Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below.
Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

    Node.js
    npm (or yarn)

Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

npm install

This will install all the required packages listed in package.json.
Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
npm start

Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make changes, and any lint errors will be shown in the console.
npm test

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. This is where you can run and monitor tests for different features of the e-commerce platform, including cart functionality, checkout process, product display, etc.
npm run build

Builds the app for production in the build folder. The build is optimized for the best performance and can be deployed to your production environment.
npm run eject

Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you're not satisfied with the default build configuration (Webpack, Babel, ESLint), you can eject at any time. This will expose all the configuration files, giving you full control over the build process. However, this step is usually not necessary for most users.
Project Structure

This is the basic structure for the e-commerce app:

/src
  /components        // React components for product listing, cart, checkout, etc.
  /redux            // Redux store setup for state management
  /api              // API calls to interact with backend for products, cart, orders
  /styles           // Styles for your app
  /utils            // Utility functions like calculations for total price
  /views            // Different views for product pages, cart, checkout, etc.
  App.js            // Main app entry point
  index.js          // Entry point for React rendering

Features

    Product Listing: Display a list of products with their details (name, price, description, image).
    Cart Functionality: Add, remove, and update product quantities in the shopping cart.
    Checkout Flow: Manage a simple checkout process with basic user inputs.
    State Management: Uses Redux to manage global state (cart items, user authentication, etc.).
    API Integration: Connect to a backend (or mock data) for product and order management.

Learn More

    To learn more about how to work with React, check out the official React documentation.
    If you're new to Redux, take a look at the Redux documentation.
    For advanced usage and deployment instructions, please refer to the Create React App documentation.

Deployment

To deploy the app, simply build the production version using npm run build, and deploy the build/ folder to your hosting platform (such as Netlify, Vercel, or AWS).
